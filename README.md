# Few-Shot-Learning-with-CIFAR-100-Dataset
A Python code to demonstrate few-shot learning on the CIFAR-100 dataset  either by fine tuning a pre-trained model or a training custom model created from scratch.
By Implementing this model i achieved the remarkable accuracy of 98.18%. You can see the files in master branch.
The model size is bigger than the recommended file size supported by Github so you can find all the file from the google drive, here is the link : " https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TXZDQkRYA1hW5nwxT07VXpUv9lAlbuYK/view?usp=sharing"
Thank you, and let me know if you have any suggestion or ideas.
